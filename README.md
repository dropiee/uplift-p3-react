# FFXIV Relic Tracker React Frontend

https://uplift-p3-react.vercel.app/

The first iteration of the frontend for my [FFXIV Relic Tracker app.](https://github.com/dropiee/ffxiv-relic-tracker) 

This is a tracker for relic weapons in Final Fantasy XIV. Made as a way to track your progress in your relic weapon journey.

Features a list of all required steps for each stage of your relic weapon, as well as all its associated quests.

Currently only includes Zodiac weapons for ARR.

The design is largely unfinished, but it works so eh.

Made with React and created as a project for Uplift's full stack program.
